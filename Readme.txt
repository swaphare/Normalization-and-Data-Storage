Liquor Inventory Management

The dataset contains information on the name, kind, price, quantity, and location of sale of sales of individual containers or packages of containers of liquor sold in different counties of Iowa state for a brief period of time. With the usage of this dataset, we aim to create an inventory management system which can help to track the in-demand products, effectively help to manage warehousing spaces by analyzing the dataset.

There are a total of 8 tables in our schema.
All 8 tables have either a primary key or foreign key or both present in it.
We created tables using Postgre sql UI and while creating the table, declared the primary key of the table and the datatypes for all the attributes.

We then created individual csv for each table and loaded them to postgre with the help of its UI to import data. After, the data was imported we then declared the foreign keys for each table as per our updated ER diagram.

We have attached the original dataset with this folder
